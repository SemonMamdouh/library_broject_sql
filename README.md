# 📚 Library System in Python (OOP Project)

This project is a **Library Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python within a Jupyter Notebook. It simulates a simple system where users can view available books, borrow a book, or return a book — all using class-based structure and interactive console inputs.

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate core OOP concepts in Python through a real-world example: managing a basic library.

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Used

- ✅ **Classes and Objects**
- ✅ **Encapsulation**
- ✅ **Instance Methods**
- ✅ **Constructors (`__init__`)**
- ✅ **Interaction Between Classes**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧩 Features

- View available books in the library
- Borrow a book (if available)
- Return a borrowed book
- Interactive text-based interface
- Easy to expand (e.g., track users or due dates)

## 📂 Project Structure

The system includes two main classes:

- `Library` – handles book storage, borrowing, and returning
- `Student` – handles user interaction and requests

### Example Flow

```text
Welcome to the Library!
Choose an option:
1. List all available books
2. Request a book
3. Return a book
4. Exit the library

Enter your choice: 1
Books currently available: ['Python', 'Data Science', 'Machine Learning']
